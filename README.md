# ParkingScenes: A Structured Dataset for End-to-End Autonomous Parking in Simulation

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

## Introduction

**ParkingScenes** is a multimodal dataset specifically designed for **end-to-end autonomous parking** research.  
Built entirely in the **CARLA simulator**, ParkingScenes provides structured, high-fidelity parking trajectories generated by **Hybrid A\*** planning and **Model Predictive Control (MPC)**, supporting scalable training and reproducible evaluation of autonomous parking systems.

This repository provides access to the dataset and will include the data collection pipeline and usage examples in the future.

## Dataset Highlights

- **704** structured parking episodes (reverse-in and parallel parking scenarios)
- **105,000+** synchronized frames
- **Multimodal data**:  
  - 4 RGB surround-view images  
  - 4 depth maps  
  - Birdâ€™s-Eye View (BEV) semantic representations  
  - Vehicle motion states  
  - Control commands (steering, throttle, brake)
- **Scenarios** with and without dynamic pedestrians
- **Structured supervision** generated by Hybrid A\* planner and MPC controller
- **Collection pipeline open-source plan** (coming soon)
